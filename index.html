        <p>The Salt March was an act of nonviolent civil disobedience in colonial India led by Mahatma Gandhi.</p> 
        <p>It was a protest against the British salt monopoly, which among other things, forbade Indians from making their own salt.</p> 
        <p>The march started from Gandhi's ashram at Sabarmati in Gujarat and ended at Dandi on the west coast of India. It was a journey of 390 km.
        <p>The twenty-four day march lasted from 12 March 1930 to 5 April 1930 as a direct action campaign of tax resistance and nonviolent protest against the British salt monopoly.</p>
        <p>Once the marchers reached the ocean, they began to make salt on the beaches of the Arabian Sea.</p>
        <p>The protesters were assaulted with police batons, arrested, and imprisoned.</p>
        <p>The protest helped to bring the plight of the Indian population to world attention and was one of the successful parts of the campaign for Indian Independence.</p>
